A word counter is a tool or program that calculates the number of words in a given text or document. It is commonly used in various contexts, including writing, editing, academic research, and data analysis. The primary function of a word counter is to provide an accurate count of the words present in a piece of text, helping users to manage and analyze written content more effectively.

Word counters typically operate by scanning through the text and identifying individual words based on whitespace or punctuation marks. They may also account for hyphenated words, alphanumeric combinations, and other factors depending on their level of sophistication. Once the counting process is complete, the word counter displays the total word count to the user, often accompanied by additional statistics such as character count, line count, and average word length.
